LearningPhaser
==============

So this is me , a 16 year old guy from greece that has a 3-4 year background of server development mostly java (but other languages as well). It's tme for me to go ahead and learn how to code for the web. I have developed several games on desktop and because a friend php guy calls me "eye cancer" due to my bad frontend gui design I have decided to stick with a game framework. A two-days chat over at https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp and a guy recommended phaser.io . I was like "let's do this , and I gonna livestream". SO I have already done the first episode and I will keep doing it. The first episode is here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98lzwLusYc . I will keep uploading stuff weekly and will summarize the knowledge I have gained through a shorter video that is going to hopefully give beginners an easier path through "The Dip".
P.S. I need to do ma homework. Approx 1-1:30 hours. I live in Greece so that is GMT+2.
If someone wants to do a little hangout talk I would be happy to do it. Questions?Feel free Suggestions?Same thing I am open to everything and looking for an art guy to practise my game development skills
